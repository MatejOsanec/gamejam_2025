# Notepad
Simple library to sprinkle notes throughout the Unity editor

## Usage
Either add the NotepadComponent to your Game Object, or make a field of type _NoteSO_. The inspector will automatically add the required additional UI.

## Notes
- Rich text is supported, so you can use tags like `<b>` or `<i>`. `<a href ...>` will work in newer versions of unity
- SO files are automatically created/renamed based on the title of the note.
