# Polyglot
Beat Games fork of the Polyglot that enables multiple language support

## Getting started

This package is probably one of the version of this repository: https://github.com/agens-no/PolyglotUnity

We don't use most of the features it was implemented and we redesign it to not use Singletons. It does not make sense to keep them in sync anymore, so we convert it to a Beat Games library.

TODO: Explain our version of Polyglot architecture


## Roadmap

- Fix namespace and code style
- Integrate with LocalizationEditor assembly
