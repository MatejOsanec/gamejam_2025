# Dotnet Extension
Utilities and extension classes for .Net Framework

## Getting started

Package with common C# and .Net extension libraries, mostly static functions and helpers used all over the game.

## Known issues

The classes are not in the proper namespace, we need to move them when we have fewer branches to avoid merge conflicts

Rename Helpers to Extensions

## Roadmap

TODO: Write a roadmap of features for this tool and how can users collaborate
