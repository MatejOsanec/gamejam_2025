# Unity Extension

Common Unity-related functions

## Getting started

Package with common Unity-related extension code, mostly static functions and helpers used all over the game and editor.

### Scriptable Object Factory

This is tool to help you create new ScriptableObject without creating a menu for each SO.


## Known issues

The classes are not in the proper namespace, we need to move them when we have fewer branches to avoid merge conflicts

Rename Helpers to Extensions

## Roadmap

TODO: Write a roadmap of features for this tool and how can users collaborate
